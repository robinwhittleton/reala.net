<h1>Books</h1>

<p>As a hobby I produce libre ebooks for <a href="https://standardebooks.org/">Standard Ebooks</a>. I take existing transcriptions (usually from <a href="https://gutenberg.org/">Gutenberg</a>) that are now public domain (in the US at least as it’s a US project), tidy them up with nice typography and high quality markup, proof-read them again, and then maintain them after publication with fixes and updates. If nothing else, I’ve read far more books now than I had before I started doing this, but it also feels good to give something back.</p>

<h2>The {{ site.data.books.size }} books I’ve produced so far</h2>

<ul class="books">
	{% for book in site.data.books %}
		<li>
			<a href="{{ book.link }}">
				<img src="/assets/images/books/{{ book.image }}" alt=""/>
				<i>{{ book.title }}</i> by {{ book.author }}
			</a>
		</li>
	{% endfor %}
</ul>
