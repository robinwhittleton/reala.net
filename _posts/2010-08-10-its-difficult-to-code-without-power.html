title: It’s difficult to code without power

<p>I’m currently typing this post on my iPhone as the power on Guildford High Street is dead again. Being a web company has many advantages but coping with power loss isn’t one of them, as the silence (apart from the beeping <abbr>UPS</abbr>) testifies. Luckily our servers have enough power to shutdown gracefully and automatically, but desktop computers don’t like the lack of power and laptops and iPads lose connection when the switch goes down too.</p>
<p>Coping strategies so far have been an office wide spring clean, the designers hauling out the HB pencils again, and a general moaning from the developers who don’t have laptops and a current git repository clone.</p>
<p>Anyone got any tips on working around power loss? Ideas for web related work that can be done with a pen and paper and iPad with no net connection?</p>
